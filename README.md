# FAQ Retrieval System

## 🎯 System Overview

This system solves the challenge of providing accurate, contextual answers to user questions by combining multiple AI techniques:

- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Semantic similarity + keyword matching + category classification
- **Confidence-Based Responses**: Smart decision making based on answer quality
- **Data Quality Management**: Automatic cleaning and validation of FAQ data
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles edge cases and system failures elegantly
- **Real-time Analytics**: Tracks performance and user feedback

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Problem Analysis

**Core Challenge**: Users ask questions in natural language with varying phrasing, requiring the system to:
- Match intent rather than exact words
- Handle ambiguous or incomplete queries
- Provide helpful responses even when no perfect match exists
- Learn and improve from user interactions

**Key Assumptions**:
- Users prefer quick, accurate answers over comprehensive but slow responses
- Confidence indication helps users understand response quality
- Alternative suggestions improve user experience when primary answer is insufficient
- System should escalate to human support when appropriate

### Architectural Choices

#### 1. Hybrid Retrieval Strategy
```
Query Processing Pipeline:
User Query → Preprocessing → Semantic Search + Keyword Matching + Category Filtering → Confidence Scoring → Response Strategy
```

**Why Hybrid Approach**:
- **Semantic Search**: Captures intent and context using OpenAI embeddings
- **Keyword Matching**: Ensures important terms aren't missed
- **Category Classification**: Provides domain-specific filtering
- **Combined Scoring**: Balances different signal strengths

#### 2. Confidence-Based Response Strategy

| Confidence Level | Response Strategy | Rationale |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| > 0.8 | Direct FAQ Answer | High confidence, user gets immediate answer |
| 0.5 - 0.8 | FAQ + Clarification | Medium confidence, provide answer but ask for confirmation |
| 0.2 - 0.5 | AI Generated Response | Low confidence, use OpenAI to provide helpful guidance |
| < 0.2 | Escalate to Human | Very low confidence, human intervention needed |

#### 3. Data Quality Management

**Identified Issues in Original Data**:
- Empty questions (line 91: `"question": ""`)
- Nonsensical questions (`"asdfghjkl"`, `"What's the best pizza topping?"`)
- Mismatched Q&A pairs (pizza question with 2FA answer)
- Duplicate questions with slight variations
- Inconsistent answer quality

**Cleaning Strategy**:
- Pattern-based filtering for nonsensical content
- Duplicate detection using normalized question text
- Category classification for better organization
- Keyword extraction for improved matching

#### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Embedding Caching**: Avoid repeated OpenAI API calls for same queries
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better scalability
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient embedding generation for all FAQs
- **Memory Management**: Limited cache sizes and cleanup routines

### Technology Stack Justification

| Technology | Purpose | Why Chosen |
|------------|---------|------------|
| FastAPI | Web Framework | Async support, automatic API docs, type safety |
| OpenAI API | Embeddings & Generation | State-of-the-art semantic understanding |
| NumPy | Vector Operations | Efficient similarity computations |
| ArangoDB | Future Analytics | Graph database for complex query analysis |
| Docker | Deployment | Consistent environments, easy scaling |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key
- 8000 and 8529 ports available
- Internet connection for OpenAI API

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd faq-rag
```

2. **Create environment file**:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
# Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
```

Or manually create `.env` with the following content:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> **Important**: Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key. You can get one from [OpenAI's API dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

3. **Start the system**:
```bash
./start.sh
```

### Launch System

The script will:
1. Check dependencies and Docker status
2. Clean up any existing containers
3. Build and start all services
4. Wait for health checks to pass
5. Automatically open your browser to the interface
6. Display management commands and API endpoints
